Love this stuff!,Great product. Received a sample as a gift in store and have already bought it again twice since. It's one of those products that creates the same results EVERY TIME!

Amazing results,"I followed the instructions and tried this out everyday for about a week. I recieved this free from Influenster to try out and I loved it. It's super interesting and I have never used anything like this before. I like the fact it's a powder that then turns into a liquid consistency when put with water. This exfoliates very gently which I like and leaves your skin feeling the cleanest it has ever felt. However, I don't think my skin liked being exfoliated everyday even though it's a daily exfoliant. So i tend to use this product about every 3 days to not over dry my skin. It has a really nice smell to it aswell, not too powerful. Would definitely recommend to all skin types.",No,5 years ago,devon,0,0,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Travel Necessity for Good Skin,"Was turned on to this product when researching how to improve make up application for textured skin. Bought a promo set during the holidays that included the Active Moist cream and I'm hooked on both. Yields the expected results of clean, smooth skin and since this is travel size, it's a plus so I don't have to compromise when on the road. I use everyday and don't have to use a separate soap cleanser and my skin is clean yet not dried out. So good I bought a backup and then a full size (elsewhere since this price point is outrageous). Highly recommend for mature skin maintenance.",No,5 years ago,"RTP, NC",0,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Super small,"For those curious, this is a .14 ounce size. That's about it a third of the travel size, which is .45 ounces and $15. So, a value of less than $5.

Great Cleanser!,"From the first time I used the Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Cleanser, I loved it. I have tried many different types of cleansers over the years, including others by Dermalogica, but this one is so creamy and leaves your face feeling so soft compared to other products I've tried. You don't need a lot. I did make that mistake and it took a bit to get it all rinsed off. Other than that mistake on my part it's been wonderful.

Like washing your face with fireplace ashes,"Pros: Like Dermalogica's Daily Microfoliant (a fave!) this scrub is gentle enough to use everyday. The grains dissolve easily and don't get under my contacts. It also doesn't dry out my skin - very important in winter. Cons: A CHARCOAL MESS! When washing at the sink, the black water stains everything. Use an old, dark towel. You can't use this scrub in the shower because the humidity makes it clump and clog the opening. I didn't find that it cleared my pores better than the original, nor better than other charcoal/pore cleansers. Luckily I bought this during an Ulta 21 Days Sale, so I paid half the price. Even at 50% off, I wouldn't purchase this again.",No,1 month ago,"Marietta, GA",0,1,Daily Superfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23
Love!,"I love this microfoliant! I have sensitive skin, so I need something gentle and this does the trick. It says you can use daily, and I have used it daily in the past with no issues. I'm currently using it once or twice a week. It has been particularly helpful in reducing pore visibility/congestion on my nose and chin area.

From a Picky Skeptic to One Who Tells You to Go Get One,"Alright guys! I'm picky and was tired of getting skin care that was hyped up and overpriced. Brand names were charging for their name and drug store products were hit and misses. So back to the review. I went into ULTA with very dry and flaky skin. When I say dry and flaky, the dessert is what you should picture. I had foundation on and you could really see how bad it was. I have combination skin. An oily T-Zone, dry around and on my nose, my chin, and also some on my temples. The rest is normal. I had an amazing girl listen to me and only for that reason I gave Dermalogica a try. I purchased the gel cleanser, this Thermafoliant, and the oil-free face lotion. I though if I didn't like it, I will bring it back. I was diligent to do my part. I started immediately. You guys, by day four, I was blown away! After day four, I put my foundation on, and I saw maybe two little spots of dryness and definitely no flaking. This thermafoliant feels so amazing when you use it. When you put it on your skin with water, it warms up, and it feels like a little spa day for your face. The grit is a perfect size and it does not scratch your face but it does the perfect job of exfoliating your face. With as much dead skin as I had on my face, I cannot believe that I saw such a quick turnaround and I am in my late thirties. I did not use any other products other than the three I've mentioned. It has been around three weeks now and my skin has never looked any better. I know the price is up there but this product will last you for quite a long time. If you're like me and like shopping online, I hope this review helps. If you get a chance to stop by an ULTA store, ask them to give you a tiny drop of this so you can feel how it warms up and exfoliates on the top of your hand.",No,5 years ago,Spartanburg SC,4,1,Multi-Vitamin Thermafoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

An exfoliator that actually works :),"I got sent the Superfoliant to test out by Influenster.

Good exfoliant,"I spoke to the store estetician during this purchase. She let me try it before I buy it. It has a very very fine grain. I bought it to help with milia spots (tiny white heads that get stuck under the skin after a pimple has healed). First wash your face, then while your face is still wet, put a bit of the dust in your palm and mix with just a few drops of water. Not enough water and it does dry on your face as you are massaging onto skin. I have had it for close to a week and although I don't see a major improvement just yet, I can tell that it is definitely helping remove dead layers of skin and getting those little buggers closer to the surface.",Yes,5 years ago,"Fargo, ND",0,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

Changed my skin for the better,"The results for me were instant and excellent. My skin was immediately so, so much smoother after the first use and continues to improve in quality the longer I use the product. The appearance of black heads and clogged looking pores has really reduced - the improvement is particularly visible around my nose where I normally have issues. I find that so long as I am stringent with using plenty of hydrating serums and moisturisers, the exfoliator does not cause my skin to dry out and hasn't lead to an eczema breakout thus far. Although I did find that I had a breakout of spots around my chin and forehead when I tried to use it daily (a common side effect of over exfoliating). I'm not sure whether I was just being too vigorous with my massaging or whether my skin is too sensitive for daily exfoliants. However, reducing usage to every second day has cleared this problem up nicely. I use it on freshly cleansed skin by carefully tipping a small amount of the charcoal coloured powder into wet hands, rubbing them together then mixes the powder into a slightly foamy paste. I then massage this in circular motions to my face, avoiding the eye area, for approximately a minute. To finish up - rinse with warm water and pat dry I'll definitely be repurchasing when this runs out (if it ever does - it is lasting for ages!). I'm especially concerned about the effect of pollutants on my skin given that I live in a busy city centre so for me Daily Superfoliant is an absolute win.

I'm not sure if this is the ""holy grail"" for oily skin, but so far it's been fantastic. THIS IS IN POWDER FORM AND REQUIRES WATER TO ACTIVIATE IT! I didn't see that part until I watched a YouTube review after I'd ordered. If it feels too gritty just add a drop or 2 of water for a smoother texture. I don't have sensitive skin, but have had to skip a day here and there because my nose (sides of nostril area) gets a kind of raw/chapped feeling but that could be from a product combo issue.

Great cleanser!,"After trying Dermalogica intensive moisture cleanser for 4 weeks now, I've really noticed a great change in my skin. This didnt strip or dry out my skin, like most cleansers out there. It left no greasy feeling and really soaked into my skin as I cleansed my face. Somedays there was no need for extra moisturizer even! I have read some other reviews on this product and people were comparing this formula to an older formula that Dermalogica had.

ANOTHER new staple in my routine!,"I was surprised to see it is just a powder. I have not tried anything like this before, but I know Dermalogica makes amazing products, so I'm very glad I decided to give this a try! I used a little too much water to activate it. Just use a few drops of water and go from there until you get your desired consistency. Even though I lost a little product, ended up getting a great quick facial out of it! Since this Daily Microfoliant is literally meant to be used daily, there is no need to overdo it. GENTLY rub your face for up to 1 minute, then rinse. After my first use, I had the softest skin, and my actives I always use actually stung a little. Don't be fooled by the Daily Microfoliant smooth texture, it is definitely an exfoliator!! I'm going to use this nightly to give my skin a perfect canvas for my PM routine. I'm not big on daily physical exfoliating, but this product might just change my mind.

life saver.,"i used to have a lot of acne I mean I went from taking acne medication twice to trying all the products in the market , went to a professional cosmetologist I literally did everything and nothing was working. Something always worked for a while, or seem to be working but the blackheads and pimples were just still there . I recently got this and have been using it for one month and omg ! All my acne is gone the blackheads I had on my cheeks and forhead are gone, if i start getting a pimple this makes it less visible , not red and it goes away the same day. This and the special cleaning gel as well as the overnight clearing gel has SAVED MY SKIN now my scars are going away as well and it's all due mainly to this product . this has also reduced my oil production.

Nice addition to the routine,About a year ago I went into my local Dermalogica story (Scottsdale) and wanted to try a bit of a stronger exfoliant than the Daily Microfoliant (which I love) for my t-zone area to help clear out blackheads a bit more. I first tried the Skin Prep Scrub but that was a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin so then tried this one and it's great. I like to use it once or twice a week and then the Daily Microfoliant on the other days. I find it helps just clear out a bit of the extra congestion in my t-zone area and makes my skin feel super smooth.

Turns out that I immediately noticed my skin was brighter when I rinsed it off and with each day , each use my skin looks better each day. I only use it at night before I go to bed because of sone of the ingress in it and I do not like going bin the sun after I exfoliate. I did notice this morning that my skin is starting to peel( which is great). Its a very mild peel though , not very noticeable at all unless your looking at a magnifying mirror and light. Also my skin is self extracting. I noticed two pimples this morning that had actually extracted themselves so I finished the rest. Now, these pimples were not on ly face before , so what's happening is the dead skin is coming off my skin which is causing impurities to come to surface. Again, these are also very small pimples that are not noticeable unless you are looking at a magnifying mirror and lamp .

Very Nice but Dispenser Broke,"I really do love this product, but Dermalogica could have put this in a tube and it would have been fine. Or a pump dispenser.

Luckily, I have a metal tool for scrapping out the last bit of skincare. I had to shove the metal stick right through the collapsed dispenser and use it to push down the plastic bit you can see in the column and dispense product that way.

This product has changed my skin for the better and I will never ever be without it again. It is gentle on my skin and feels amazing to use. My skin is now smoother and softer than it has ever been and it has cleared up some of my under-skin bumps that I was suffering with. The product can be a little messy to use and took a while to get used to. You only need a little of the powder and mixed with some water it creates a paste. Massage into the face in circular motions for one minute and then I usually remove it with a muslin cloth and hand-hot water. It honestly feels like a pamper session each morning!

Please Read My Review!,"I was first introduced to this product when I was in school to become an esthetician and I'm just as in love with it now as I was back then. I have dry, sensitive skin but this does not bother it at all. I was using Tatcha Rice Powder but that started making me break out in hives so I switched back to this. It evens out my skin texture, brightens, and helps control my occasional hormonal breakouts on my chin. I use it every night after I wash my face and before I apply my toner/serum/moisturizer. It's not intended to remove make up so make sure you still remove make up prior to using this. Also it does come out as a powder so some say it can be ""messy"" but you only need a little bit and that goes a long way. Make sure you add just enough water to make it a foamy paste (too little of water and its harsh on the skin; too much water and it'll just seep through your hands and down the sink). Even though I don't have oily or acne prone skin, I'd still recommend this to those who do because of the papain and salicylic acid thats in it will help you along with other products you already use. It's pricy but its worth it and the regular size bottle will last you a long time. You'll get your moneys worth.

"This is better, this is what I need!","I probably would not have written a review, but I had results right away and was amazed. Every time I get a facial they tell me I haven't been exfoliating enough. I just got a Derma plane a few weeks ago where it seemed like they took off half an inch of skin - this product is very similar to a dermaplane!!! Of course it's not a the actually shaving off of the skin but I mean I left it on for a pretty long time because I got distracted and when I washed it off my skin was tight, and had a new glow to it. My skin feels pretty close to what it was after my derma plan a few weeks ago my skin was very exfoliated. This product REALLY WORKS I have been using the microfolient for years now, but I do not use it often enough to notice any difference. This super folient is like getting an exfoliation facial. I guess I will finish the microfolient I have and try to use it more daily - would hate to waste it - the microfolient can be used daily but this super folient is probably too strong. I would not use it every day, but perhaps I could use it once per week? In winter this could make the skin dry, but definitely in summer this will help. I have skin damage on the top of my forehead. So this completely addressed that. I will probably use this superfolient every 1-2 weeks. I have combination skin.

Best every day exfoliant,"This is the perfect exfoliant. The price is a little out of my range for the full size - but when I can afford it, I'm getting it! I've been using this product for years and I've found deals here and there (21 days of beauty, now they offer the smaller size, etc.). But when I'm actively broken out in acne I can use this to get rid of dry skin because it has salicylic acid and even though it gets rid of all my dry skin - the exfoliation isn't at all too-abrasive so it won't just open the breakouts and spread the bacteria like most exfoliators. A life saver. It doesn't smell so good - but it's not potent at all and it's only if I'm actively trying to smell it and I'd prefer that over a fragrance that harms the skin any day.

Once you've got a good consistency just rub it in with your fingers then rinse.

My skin feels GREAT after use...but I noticed breakouts,"I received a set of dermalogica superfoliant, multi-vitamin power recovery mask and dynamic skin recovery cream from a friend as a gift. I have never used this brand before and as always, felt bit skeptical about it. In any case, I gave it a try. First I used the superfoliant which has terrible smell (not gonna lie) but that's probably b/c it is natural, without all the 'extra chemicals' so I was fine with it. My face felt super smooth and clean. I then applied the multi-vitamin recovery mask which went on smooth but then my face started to burn, really badly so I had to wash it off. I figured, ok - let me apply that recovery cream and then all heck broke loose. My skin was RED and very irritated so had to wash it all off with water which did help. I tried the multi-vitamin recovery mask on its own few other times as well as the dynamic skin recovery and unfortunately not only did it irritate my skin but I noticed break-outs. I don't remember the last time I broke out like this. Bottom line - I've read and heard great things about this brand but it really depends on your skin type and how it may react to the products.

Great for acne prone skin?!,"So I use Curology as my main skincare and acne medication. However, shipment has been super slow so I have not had my medication for a week now. Luckily I was able to try out this product, 1st night went well it didn't irritate my skin 'nor did it cause any acne, so I tried it again at night since it says daily uses, and since I don't have medication anymore I thought why not use something that can get rid of any bacteria on my face. It has been a WEEK of me using THIS AND MY SKIN ACTUALLY CLEARED UP. Yes I got acne still BUT THEY WERE TINY, all I did was put a salicylic spot treatment and they were gone the next day.

i love dermalogica,"Honestly - dermalogica has been a total game changer. I am obsessed with their entire line. I love my esthetician at Ulta and we talked about my needs after my facial and this is something she recommended to me along with precleanse (IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS - YOU SHOULD BECAUSE ITS THE BEST). It's gentle and I feel like it will last me forever. The only reason I decided to write a review is after reading the con list. FIRST OFF - this is NOT a makeup remover. This is to exfoliate your skin. You should be REMOVING your makeup before you use this. If not - you're just rubbing your makeup into your pores. Also - if you don't exfoliate on a regular basis I wouldn't start using this every day. Although it's very, very gentle - so is your skin. Give your skin time to adjust and start adding this into your routine slow and be sure to follow up with a moisturizer. It is pricey but I have not found anything remotely this gentle before. To me, it's worth spending the money on this. I know it won't damage my skin and because I use it a handful of times a week it will last me forever. I also do not find it messy. You pour a little into your hand and add a little bit of water and then gently massage into your skin. I highly recommend this among a ton of other dermalogica products. It's worth the money to invest in your skin! This is a GOOD brand who doesn't add BS into their products. I will forever be obsessed.",No,6 years ago,"Long Island, NY",5,0,Daily Microfoliant,Dermalogica,3/27/23

A gentle exfoliant that gets the job done!,"I really have enjoyed using this product! I will start by saying that the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it just felt a little messy to me! The powder somes out pretty quickly and the paste can get a little saturated- apart from that it's easy to use! I have sensitive skin that is dry in some areas (particularly nose and chin) and this has dramatically reduced this. I don't usually like to use scrubs as often it leaves my skin feeling raw and red.
